        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Hainan Chicken rice is a classic dish in my Cantonese family household, and is also beloved by people in Singapore and all over Asia. This comfort food dish features 'fall-off-the-bone' chopped up chicken thighs, rice rich with chicken broth, and the star of the dish: ginger and scallion sauce. It takes less than 40 minutes to make using your rice cooker!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 bone-in chicken thighs</li>
                <li>3 cups uncooked rice</li>
                <li>1 bundle of yu choy</li>
                <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>4 tbsp chicken bouillon powder</li>
                <li>5 whole scallions</li>
                <li>3 tbsp oil</li>
                <li>13 cups water</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Chop up the chicken thighs to at least 1/2 inch pieces. Season them with salt and pepper according to your liking. Set the seasoned chicken thighs into the bottom of the instant pot.</li>
                <li>Slice the ginger root into thin 1/8 inch pieces. Put half of the cut up ginger pieces into the pot spread out over the chicken</li>
                <li>Cut 3 whole scallions into 3 segments each. Put half of the segmented scallions into the pot.</li>
                <li>Wash the uncooked rice at least three times. Pour the rice into the pot. Fill the pot with 13 cups water.</li>
                <li>Chop up the 4 garlic cloves. Add the chicken bouillon powder, garlic, and the rest of the sliced ginger and segmented scallions into the pot. Close the instant pot and set the settings as you normally would when cooking rice by itself.</li>
                <li>As the meal cooks, wash the yu choy. Chop the yu choy into 3 segments each. Place the yu choy in a large microwaveable dish and place a paper towel on top of the bowl. Microwave the yu choy for 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Slice up the remaining ginger into 1/8 pieces, and chop up the 2 whole scallions into 1/8 pieces. Place the ginger, scallions, oil, and salt to taste in a food processor. Process until well-blended.</li>
