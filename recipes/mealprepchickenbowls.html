                <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil (divided)</li>
                <li>1-1 1/2 pounds chicken breasts (cubed)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Meal Prep Burrito Bowls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups chopped kale (or lettuce of choice)</li>
                <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 cup halved grape tomatoes</li>
                <li>1/2 cup corn</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups cooked black beans</li>
                <li>2 cups cooked brown rice</li>
                <li>chopped fresh cilantro (to taste)</li>
                <li>Store-bought Avocado Lime Sauce or Chipotle Sauce</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Cook the Chicken</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the apple cider vinegar, dried spices, minced garlic, fresh cilantro, and 1/2 tbsp of olive oil in a large bowl or container.</li>
                <li>Add the cubed chicken and coat evenly in the marinade. Cover and let it marinate for a few minutes while you prep the other ingredients (you could also marinate it in the fridge the night before to save time the next day and for a better flavor).</li>
                <li>When ready to cook, add the remaining olive oil to a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken (along with any leftover marinade) and cook for about 12-15 minutes, or until brown and cooked through, stirring occasionally.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Assemble the Bowls</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Meanwhile, lightly "massage" the kale with the olive oil and salt.</li>
                <li>Divide it into 4 bowls along with the tomatoes, corn, black beans, cooked rice, and cilantro.</li>
                <li>Let the chicken rest and cool for a few minutes after it's done cooking.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken to the bowls and drizzle with the sauce (or keep separate until ready to enjoy)!</li>
            </ol>
